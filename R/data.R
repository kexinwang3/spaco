#' The dataset consists of 180 samples across 135 immunological features
#' collected from 98 participants infected with COVID-19. Viral RNA load,
#' levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines, and leukocyte profiles were
#' assessed in the study. Follow-up measurements of the patients included 1 to
#' 7 longitudinal time points, occurring 3-51 days after symptom onset.
